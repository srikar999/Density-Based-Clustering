# Density-Based-Clustering
The Density-based Clustering tool works by detecting areas where points are concentrated and where they are separated by areas that are empty or sparse. Points that are not part of a cluster are labeled as noise.  This tool uses unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms which automatically detect patterns based purely on spatial location and the distance to a specified number of neighbors. These algorithms are considered unsupervised because they do not require any training on what it means to be a cluster.
